===
Blending.
Linear blending is not enough to get a high score.
I split the test data into several data set and blend each 
with different predictors and different weights.

Language , children and grandparent predictors are not so usefull
in my solution. 

I don't figure out  why filters didn't work neither, oooops.

The idea blending method should hits 2800 in my test data, while 
only nearly 2400 were hit actually. 

Todo
====
Learn the weights in KNN
More good clusters
More smart blending method
Read the codes and idea of the leading guy carefully.
